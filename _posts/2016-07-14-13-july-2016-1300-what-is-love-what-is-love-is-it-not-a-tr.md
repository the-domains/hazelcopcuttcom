  you pick To unlock the fortress The fortress of your mind? No, tis for the
  heart For the heart to flare and scream An exaggerated time to clean Clean you
  soul of the physical dream To burn in Hell and if it were heaven. As above and
  so below Heaven and hell we'll go One for ir the Spirit One for the soul The
  Love is divided But no one Ever Told.

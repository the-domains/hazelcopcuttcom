  13 JULY 2016, 13:00 What is Love?What is Love Is it not a trick, A trick that
  you pick, To unlock the fortress, The fortress of your mind? No, tis for the
  heart, For the heart to flare and scream, An exaggerated time to clean, Clean
  you soul of the physical dream, To burn in Hell and if it were heaven. As
  above and so below, Heaven and hell we'll go, One for the Spirit, One for the
  soul, The Love is divided, But no one Ever Told.
